# üìö Team Webpage Project

## üìù Introduction
This is a collaborative website created by a team of four:
- **MUHAMMAD FAYED BIN MOHD FAZAL**
- **MUHAMMAD ADAM HARRIS BIN AZHAR**
- **CHENG CHIN KIET**
- **JOSHUA WONG HOCK SING**

The site consists of a **main homepage** and **four individual homepages**, all connected through internal links.  
Built entirely with **HTML** and **CSS**, the project demonstrates clean design, responsive layout, and simple navigation.

## üìÇ File Structure

> **Tip:** Update the filenames above if your actual HTML files use different names.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Files to Open
- **Executable / Entry File:** `index.html`  
  Open this file first; it serves as the starting point of the site.

- Each team member‚Äôs page (`fayed.html`, `adam.html`, `cheng.html`, `joshua.html`) is linked from the main homepage and can also be opened directly in a browser.

---

## üöÄ How to Run the Website
1. **Download or Clone** the entire project folder from the repository.
2. Locate and double-click **`index.html`**.  
   Your default web browser will automatically launch the main homepage.
3. Use the navigation links to explore each member‚Äôs individual page.

No build process or external dependencies are required‚Äîthis is pure HTML and CSS.

## üí° Notes
- For the best viewing experience, use a modern browser such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari.
- All pages share the same stylesheet for a consistent look and feel.
