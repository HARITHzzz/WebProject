# Team Webpage Project

## 📖 Introduction
This project is a collaborative website created by a team of four.  
It showcases a **main homepage** and **four individual homepages** (one for each team member) built with **HTML** and **CSS** only—no external frameworks required.  
The goal is to demonstrate basic front-end development skills and cohesive design across multiple pages.

## 📂 File Structure



> **Tip:** Replace `member1.html`, `member2.html`, etc. with your actual filenames if they differ.

## ▶️ Which File to Open
- **Executable / Entry File:** `index.html`  
  This is the main homepage and the starting point of the site.

- The other HTML files (`member1.html`, `member2.html`, etc.) can be opened individually, but they are also linked from the main page for easy navigation.

## 🛠️ How to Run the Website
1. **Download or Clone** the entire project folder to your computer.
2. Open the folder and double-click **`index.html`**.  
   Your default web browser will launch and display the homepage.
3. Navigate through the links to view each member’s personal homepage.
