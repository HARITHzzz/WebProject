# WebProject


> **Tip:** Replace `member1.html`, `member2.html`, etc. with your actual filenames if they differ.

## ▶️ Which File to Open
- **Executable / Entry File:** `index.html`  
  This is the main homepage and the starting point of the site.

- The other HTML files (`member1.html`, `member2.html`, etc.) can be opened individually, but they are also linked from the main page for easy navigation.

## 🛠️ How to Run the Website
1. **Download or Clone** the entire project folder to your computer.
2. Open the folder and double-click **`index.html`**.  
   Your default web browser will launch and display the homepage.
3. Navigate through the links to view each member’s personal homepage.

(Add actual names and roles as needed.)

## 💡 Notes
- No build step is required—this is pure HTML and CSS.
- For best results, use a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).
